The new rewritten website with a more simplier look and more modular design for easy contributing needs.

Proudly using Bulma and Font Awesome, designed to be a simple and straight forward design.

## Setup
First, you'll want to make sure you have Ruby installed.

Once you've got Ruby installed, you need to install Jekyll. Run the command `gem install bundler jekyll` in the site's directory. Once it completes, run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`, and navigate to `localhost:4000` in your browser.

If everything worked properly, you should see the website running. If things don't work, search around on the internet, there should be solutions out there for your issue.
