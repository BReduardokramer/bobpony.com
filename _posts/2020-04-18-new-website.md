# New Website
Thanks to my friend espi, I have decided to fork it from their website and added some fixes into it and my own tweaks here and there since it was really time to rewrite the whole website since the old one was getting messy, it was more worth it to start all over again.

# New Domain
The old domain BobPony.org has been moved to BobPony.com since it was suited to be moved for reasons

# Jekyll Powered
This whole website you're seeing right now is entirely written in Jekyll as the old website was meaning it's as modular for updating things in the future and easier to maintain.
# Downloads Page
The downloads page is now redesigned for ease of access and designed to be clean looking which was based off my friend's website with tweaks. But, not only that it uses the CDN subdomain instead of relying on a 3rd party cloud storage provider for serving them.

# Closing Words
I'm quite proud that I've got the new domain since it was on my bucket list for many years, now this time I'll start on putting more work into this website and making it much better unlike last time. Maybe in the future I will setup a experimental section in the future someday where you can play with new toys and give feedback. Hope you will enjoy this new website.
