# New Website
Thanks to my friend espi, I've decided to fork it from their website and added some fixes into it and my own tweaks here and there. Plus, it was really time to rewrite the whole website since the old one was getting really messy.

# New Domain
I've moved the domain from BobPony.org to BobPony.com since it just seemed to make a bit more "sense", but anyways the old stuff from BobPony.org will still exist for some time.

# Jekyll Blog
This blog that you're seeing right now is indeed powered by Jekyll, if you're wondering where the old posts are then you may want to look at old.bobpony.com for that since I can't be really bothered to rewrite the old posts into the new website since they have major differences compared to the current rewrite.

# Downloads Page
The downloads page is now redesigned for ease of access and designed to be clean looking, it's heavily based off espi's website.

# Closing Words
I'm quite proud that I've got the new domain and maybe this time I'll probably start putting more work into this and avoid making too much mistakes unlike last time and I'll probably put up an experiments page for anyone to try out something new.
