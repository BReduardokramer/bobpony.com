# New Website
Thanks to my friend espi, I've decided to fork it from their website and added some fixes into it and my own tweaks here and there. Plus, it was really time to rewrite the whole website since the old one was getting really messy.
<br>

# New Domain
The old domain BobPony.org has been moved to BobPony.com, and the old website will still exist for whatever reason you want to look back on.
<br> 

# Jekyll Powered
This whole website you're seeing right now is entirely written in Jekyll, if you're wondering where the old posts are then you may want to look at old.bobpony.org, since I can't be really bothered right now to import the old posts into the new website since they contain major differences compared to this website.

# Downloads Page
The downloads page is now redesigned for ease of access and designed to be clean looking which was based off my friend's website with tweaks. But, not only that it uses the cdn subdomain instead of relying on a 3rd party cloud storage provider.
<br>

# Closing Words
I'm quite proud that I've got the new domain and maybe this time I'll start on putting more work into this website and making it much better unlike last time. Maybe in the future I'll setup some kind of experiments section where you can play with new toys and give feedback. Hope you'll enjoy this new website.
